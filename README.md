# A circumbinary protoplanetary disc in a polar configuration

Material associated with ALMA paper on HD 98800

Not all material is here due to volume limits, feel free to get in touch.

* Initial processing

The files selfcal.py, splits.py, and cleans.py take the data from the
ALMA calibrated state to science readiness. The folder fits contains
continuum fits files.

* Modelling

The folder vis_models contains the notebooks used to model the continuum
and CO visibilities. The continuum visibilities are given in the folder
vis_data.

* AB Orbit

The folder orbit contains the notebook used to derive the AB orbit.

* Stability

The folder nbody contains the script used to derive the n-body stability
maps.

* Figures

The folder figs contains the figures used in the paper, plus a few
others. The notebooks images, kinematics, and dynamics generate images
and do the disk configuration population model.
