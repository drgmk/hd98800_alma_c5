                DATA FROM THE WASHINGTON DOUBLE STAR CATALOGS            
                                    (WDS)
        
                         U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY                              
                         WASHINGTON D.C. 20392                             
        
   As a result of numerous changes in software and hardware, as well as the 
addition of new catalogs, information is now provided in a somewhat different 
format. It is hoped that this presentation is clearer; if it is in any way 
confusing, or there are omissions, please let us know.

   The WDS (and associated catalogs) are at present in a state of flux. At
this point the following things have been done :


General comments:
      1. Data from all catalogs are referenced to a single note file and 
         single reference file. 
      2. To facilitate those of you who make data requests on a regular
         basis I've added a "version number" to the top line so that it is
         known when this file is modified. Typically a user can just check
         these numbered notes and look for new ones.
      3. Explanatory material from the WDS "intro.doc" added to this file,
         so that all explanatory WDS material is in a single file.

WDS summary lines:
      1. Arcsecond precise coordinates have been provided when available.
      2. Secondary proper motions have been provided when available .
      3. Duplicate discovery designations have been removed. Some numbers
         had been used more than once erroneously. In addition, some
         discovery designations were given unfortunate additional
         designations ("1/2", "a", and even the Struves' use of "App"). Some
         numbers were repeated due to the discoverer having more than one
         list (Herschel lists I-VI and N come to mind). To make the WDS
         discovery designation more clear all of these duplicate
         designations have been corrected.
      4. The magnitude information in the WDS is a hodge-podge of data. Many
         systems with entries in the delta-m catalog inexplicably had little
         or no magnitude information available. These have been updated to be
         as consistent as possible, taking Tycho V magnitudes when available.
      5. X codes have been added in column 109 of the summary line when the 
         pair is questionable. Generally these are unconfirmed systems, which
         pairs may represent positional typos in the original publication 
         (thus we're looking in the wrong location), optical doubles which
         have changed greatly in separation and/or angle due to radically
         different proper motions, plate errors, or may simply be not at the
         magnitude, separation, etc., where the first measure was added (too
         faint, too close, etc.). We would certainly like to know about
         circumstances where you have found or have ascertained the mystery
         behind these pairs.
      6. The format of the WDS summary lines was changed slightly:
         a. The column for number of measures has been increased to four
            digits. Therefore, the 607 systems which previously had "99"
            measures (indicating N greater than or equal to this number) now
            have the actual number of measures. Ten systems have more than
            1000 measures, with the largest being 70 Ophiuchus with 1640.
         b. The secondary proper motion, formerly at the end of each record,
            has been moved next to the primary proper motion.
         c. An additional notes column has been added. The actual notes
            codes have not changed, however, many cases have been found
            where a note has either been not included or put in the notes
            file. Adding the additional column will eventually decrease the
            size of the notes file.
         d. Precisions of coordinate have been improved by an order of
            magnitude in each digit, i.e., tenths of a second of arc and 
            hundredths of a second of time. Nearly 99% of the pairs in the
            WDS now have coordinates to this precision.
         e. Spaces and decimals have been added where appropriate, for 
            consistency and to improve readability.
      7. The p code has been removed from the summary line codes in columns
         108-111. This code referred to "Coordinates and proper motions from
         ACRS, PPM, IRS, FK5 catalogs".
      8. Ambiguities with "P" coded proper motion (10x larger than listed) 
         have been corrected.
      9. Identification of pairs that could be physical or are certainly
         not physical are flagged, using one of several codes. See the list
         of summary catalog codes below. As of 2009.5 these were 2894 pairs 
         with physical codes and 1552 with optical codes; this represents 
         2.77% and 1.49%, respectively, of the entire catalog. True natures 
         of the vast majority of systems in the WDS are still undetermined.
     10. At present the Durchmusterung catalogs (BD, CD, CPD) are still
         used as the primary cross-reference (in addition to the precise
         coordinates). It is anticipated that once it is complete, the more 
         modern and deeper all-sky UCAC4 may be used in this role; 
         alternatively, some combination of catalogs (Hipparcos, Tycho2, 
         UCAC4, etc.) may be used for pairs of different magnitudes. In any 
         event, a historical WDS <-> DD <-> BD cross reference will be 
         available on the WDS website.
     11. The procedure for updating first and last measures has been simplified
         somewhat. Typically the first and last measures refer only to "full" 
         measures (measures which include date + theta + rho); the number of 
         measures (nmeas) counts only those full measures. A small number of 
         pairs have only "partial" measures (measures lacking one or more of the 
         three quantities). Therefore, if nmeas = 0, the first and last partial 
         measure are listed; any missing value is given as "-1".

WDS data lines:
      1. The codes to the WDS data lines (columns 125 and 126) have been 
         updated. Many codes have been removed, in favor of additional 
         information included with the measures (for example, the "D" code, 
         indicating that the separation is an upper limit, has been replaced 
         with a "<" preceding rho). See the data line format table below.
      2. Non-numeric position angles (N, NP, SF, etc.), have been converted
         to the nearest numeric position angle and a code (L) has been added 
         indicating the change.plate
      3. Measures which are likely to be in error, but cannot be corrected 
         (code "X") are not included in the ensemble of data points for the 
         summary line. Incomplete data (missing date, position angle and/or 
         separation) are also not included in the summary line.
      4. Our updating of measures, orbits, and discoveries continues.
      5. Method files for all USNO double star catalogs have been combined. 
         The new 1- and 2-letter codes (see below) provide considerably more 
         detailed information about the technique than previously possible.
      6. We are in the midst of correcting many errors in the WDS. This task
         included examining all measures containing old codes G, H, I, and J 
         as well as large outliers in orbit or linear motion calculations.
         In most cases, this involves going back to the original reference
         and examining the observation to determine what errors can be
         ascertained (often a misidentification or a typo) and corrected. We
         have gone from these four codes to a more generic code "N" 
         (corrected) or "X" (not corrected, while retaining the "I" 
         (identification questionable) code. Code "X" data are not included 
         in the summary line.
      7. Sometimes you will find that the reference is listed as 
         "unpublished". If you use such data, as a common courtesy dictates 
         that you obtain the permission of the author if possible. This 
         permission is implicitly given by us by inclusion of our own 
         unpublished measures in the data base. Also, if you make use of data 
         supplied by us, we would appreciate an acknowledgement in your
         published report or paper.

Associated catalogs:
      1. Data requests now include orbital information, ephemerides, and 
         figures illustrating the orbits and all measures, all from the 
         Sixth Orbit Catalog. See http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/orb6.html for 
         more information.
      2. Linear solutions from the "Linear Elements Catalog"
         <http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/lin1.html> as well as associated
         ephemeris and figures are now provided with data requests as well.
      3. Data from the delta-m catalog (previously unavailable) are included
         in data requests. This is from the new, 3rd magnitude difference
         catalog, over 200% larger than the first magnitude difference
         catalog. See http://ad.usno.navy.mil/wds/dm3.html for more 
         information.
      4. The Fourth Interferometric Catalog is not currently checked by this  
         program. However, virtually all relevant information from this 
         catalog has been incorporated into the WDS database during the most 
         recent reformat efforts. WDS technique codes were expanded to two
         characters in order to more complete technique descriptions in the
         Interferometric Catalog.


=============================================================================

Cross-reference (columns 99-106):

Durchmusterung number of the object in the system used by the Henry Draper 
Catalogue: 

               Bonn from +89 degrees to -22 degrees inclusive, 
            Cordoba from -23 degrees to -51 degrees inclusive, 
  Cape Photographic from -52 degrees to -89 degrees inclusive. 

When a star is not contained in the Durchmusterung proper to its declination
zone, but is contained in another Durchmusterung, this is so indicated in the
Notes. Other components having different Durchmusterung numbers are also 
indicated in the Notes.

Note that the DM designation for Aa,Ab and other subcomponents of A as well 
as AB and simple binaries (i.e., no component designation) we give the 
appropriate cross-reference for the A component.

For other pairs in multiple systems, AC, AD, AB,C, or even BC, we give the 
cross-reference of the secondary of that pairing (i.e., for the above, C, D, 
C and C).


WDS SUMMARY CATALOG - note flags (columns 108-111):    
                                                                                
                                                                          
B  Summary line gives blue (Johnson U or B, blue photographic, etc.)
   magnitudes
C  Orbit and Linear solution. A published orbit exists and this system has a 
   Linear Solution as well. A "C" code, then, indicates both an "O" and 
   an "L" code.
I  Identification uncertain. Match of object at precise position with WDS
   pair may or may not be correct. Currently under examination.
K  Summary line gives K-band or other infrared (>1 micron) magnitudes
L  Linear solution. Linear elements for this pair have been determined. 
M  Magnitude modified. Magnitudes have been corrected to the Tycho-V scale 
   based on other systems measured by the discoverer and Tycho.
N  Notes found in wdsnot.memo of the WDS.
O  Orbit, briefly described in WDSNOT MEMO and has entry in Orbit Catalog
P  100 year proper motion in right ascension and declination.
R  Summary line gives red (Johnson R or I, red photographic, etc.) magnitudes.
S  Statistically different parallax and proper motion indicates that this 
   pair is non-physical.
T  Statistically the same parallax within the errors and similar proper 
   motion or other technique indicates that this pair is physical.
U  Proper motion or other technique indicates that this pair is non-physical.
V  Proper motion or other technique indicates that this pair is physical.
X  A "Dubious Double" (or "Bogus Binary"). This pair may represent a
   positional typo in the original publication (so we're looking in the
   wrong location), an optical double disappearing due to radically
   different proper motions, a plate flaw, or simply a pair not at a
   magnitude, separation, etc., sufficiently similar to those noted when the
   first measure was added (making it too faint, too close, etc.). We would
   certainly like to know about any circumstances where you have found or
   have ascertained the mystery behind these pairs.
Y  Statistically different parallax for the components indicates they are
   non-physical.
Z  Statistically the same parallax within the errors would indicate the
   components are physical.

WDS OBSERVATION CATALOG: data line format             

The format of the WDS data lines was greatly expanded May/June 2012, in order
to accomodate more precise astrometry and photometry, as well as formal 
astrometric and photometric errors and filter information. During the process 
many old observation codes were eliminated, often by including additional 
information with the measure itself (for example, the "D" code, indicating that 
the separation is an upper limit, has been replaced with a "<" preceding rho). 
The new format is described below (note that in all cases the number of decimal 
places quoted in the catalog indicates the published precision):

SIXTH ORBIT CATALOG - elements:

P     = Period of revolution
pflag = units of period (c = centuries, d = days, h = hours, y = years)
a     = Semimajor axis of orbit
aflag = units of semimajor axis (a = arcsec, m = milliarcsec, M = arcminutes,
        u = microarcsec)  
i     = inclination, angle between plane of the sky and plane of the orbit, 
        0-180 degrees. The motion is direct (i.e., in direction of increasing
        position angles) if i < 90 and retrograde if i > 90.
Node  = Position angle of the line of intersection between the plane of the
        orbit and plane of the sky, in degrees.
T     = epoch of periastron passage
tflag = units of T (y = years, d = MJD)
e     = orbital eccentricity
omega = longitude of persiastron, in degrees 
G     = orbit grade (1 = definitive, 2 = good, 3 = reliable, 4 = preliminary,
        5 = indeterminate, 9 = unknown). The grading procedure is described
        in the introduction to the Sixth Catalog  
        (see http://ad.usno.navy.mil/ad/wds/int6.html).

Notes : In some cases more than one orbit will be provided. Cases like this
fall into one of two categories:
      1. More than one binary in a multiple system has an orbit calculated.
      2. While the orbit grading algorithm grades orbits objectively on
         many categories, they sometimes can achieve approximately the same 
         grade and the decision as to which orbit is better may be ambiguous. 
         As a rule of thumb, following the time-honored precepts of van den 
         Bos and Worley, and asking the question "Is this Orbit Really
         Necessary?" (see, for example, PASP, 74, 297; 1962 ), we answer in 
         the negative, and retain the earlier orbit. However, there still 
         remain cases where the orbits can be sufficiently different but 
         ambiguous (for example, solutions with different quadrants selected 
         for small magnitude difference systems). In this case, more than one 
         orbit may be retained.
      3. A grade 8 or 9 orbit (which was not provided in Worley & Heintz) is
         given when it is not possible to evaluate the orbit as no "classical 
         double star" data are available. 
           Interferometric orbits based solely on visibility data (i.e., no
         rho and theta provided) are given a grade of 8. Were complete data
         available these orbits (usually combined solutions with
         spectroscopic data) would undoubtedly have a very good grade.
           Astrometric orbits (derived from photocenter vs. barycenter
         shifts) are given a grade of 9. When resolved, systems of this type
         typically show rather large differences between the elements 
         computed astrometrically and those based on differential measures. 
           Further, the grades are only based on available visual double star
         data. If the solution to an orbit is based on a combined solution
         (e.g., with spectroscopic information), certain elements are
         certainly known better. Utilizers of the data are encouraged to
         thoroughly scan the "notes" section.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIXTH ORBIT CATALOG - ephemerides:

Each orbit above is provided with an ephemeris for the next five years.
While many orbits may be of poor quality, short-term ephemerides are often
quite good.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SIXTH ORBIT CATALOG - figures:

In all orbit figures in this catalog, green plus signs indicate visual 
(micrometric) observations, violet asterisks photographic measures, and blue
symbols various interferometric techniques (open circles, filled circles,
and filled squares for eyepiece interferometry, speckle or other 
single-aperture techniques, and multi-aperture techniques, respectively).
Finally, a red "H" or "T" indicates a measure from Hipparcos or Tycho. The
dot-dash line indicates the line of nodes. Scales are in arcseconds, and the
curved arrow at lower right indicates the direction of orbital motion.

==============================================================================

RECTILINEAR ELEMENTS CATALOG - elements:

The elements are defined by linear relationships relative to the closest
approach 

   x = -sin(theta) * rho
   y =  cos(theta) * rho

and let (x0,y0,t0) or (rho0,theta0,t0) define the relative location and time 
of closest approach
      
Solve for:
            x = xa * (t-t0) + x0
            y = ya * (t-t0) + y0

A standard weighted least squares fit is made, with weights of individual 
measures determined using the technique outlined in the Sixth Catalog of 
Orbits of Visual Binary Stars. RMS errors determine the errors of these 
parameters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RECTILINEAR ELEMENTS CATALOG - ephemerides:

Ephemerides for years 2010-2035 are provided with the elemental errors 
propagated into the rho and theta relative position.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RECTILINEAR ELEMENTS CATALOG - figures:

   Figures are also provided for each system, and are linked from the main 
catalog by the letter "P" in one of the righthand columns. The figures include
all measures in the WDS, as well as the linear fits whose elements are given 
in the main catalog (shown as a solid black line). Individual measures in 
these figures are color-coded as in the Orbit Catalog; green, blue, and purple
indicate micrometric, interferometric, and photographic measures, 
respectively, while a red "H" or "T" indicates a measure from Hipparcos or 
Tycho. Measures are connected to their predicted locations by "O-C" lines; 
measures given zero weight are indicates by dotted O-C's.
   For those pairs with two sets of proper motions in the WDS, a red line 
indicates the differential proper motion predicted by these values. Since most
of these proper motions are from the Hipparcos or Tycho-2 catalogs, the red 
lines intersect the least-squares fit to the data at the Hipparcos epoch of 
1991.25. The lengths of both the black and red lines correspond to a similar 
range of dates (usually roughly corresponding to the range of observation 
dates, unless T0 falls outside that range).
